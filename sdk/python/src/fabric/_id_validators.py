"""Guards for ``*_id`` identifier values: PII shape, and placeholders.

Identifier fields such as ``tenant_id``, ``agent_id``, ``user_id``,
``session_id`` and ``request_id`` are written onto every emitted span
under the ``fabric.*`` namespace. Two distinct failure modes live here.

**PII shape** (:func:`warn_if_pii_shaped`) — if callers pass values that
*look* like an email address or a phone number, those values silently
leave the process and ship to the trace backend with every decision —
a quiet PII leak that the developer never asked for. Called from
:class:`fabric.client.FabricConfig` and :class:`fabric.decision.Decision`
during construction. A single warning per ``(field_name, value)`` pair
is emitted per process via Python's :mod:`warnings` default filter; set
``FABRIC_QUIET_PII_WARN=1`` to suppress all such warnings. Here the
intent is *not* validation — opaque-but-email-shaped IDs are sometimes
intentional. The intent is to make the silent leak loud exactly once, so
an operator notices before a year of traces accumulate.
See specs/016-foundational-fixes.md §4.5.

**Placeholder identifiers** (:func:`check_identifier`) — here the intent
*is* validation, but narrowly. ``tenant_id`` and ``agent_id`` are the
partition keys of every trace, every audit record and every tenant
isolation check downstream. A value of ``"undefined"``, ``"null"`` or
``"${TENANT}"`` is never a real tenant; it is an unset variable, a
stringified ``undefined`` from a JS shim, or an unsubstituted template.
Accepting it silently merges unrelated tenants into one bogus partition
and the mistake is only discovered months later, in the audit trail.

Two tiers, both deliberately narrow:

* **Tier A — reject** (:data:`_SENTINEL_VALUES` plus unsubstituted
  template shapes). These cannot be a deliberate identifier under any
  reading. Raises :class:`ValueError`, consistent with the existing
  empty-``tenant_id`` rejection and with ``from_env``'s documented
  "fails on startup rather than on the first agent call" contract.
  ``FABRIC_ALLOW_PLACEHOLDER_IDS=1`` downgrades the raise to a
  :class:`PlaceholderIdentifierWarning` — it demotes, it does not
  silence, so an operator who genuinely must ship ``"none"`` can, and
  still sees it in the logs.
* **Tier B — warn** (:data:`_COPY_PASTE_MARKERS`). Values like
  ``"changeme"`` or ``"your-tenant"`` are overwhelmingly an uncopied
  quickstart snippet, but they *are* syntactically valid identifiers and
  someone could conceivably mean them. Warn only, never raise.

What is deliberately **NOT** validated, and why:

* **Length.** No minimum, no maximum. One-character ids are used
  throughout this SDK's own test suite and are perfectly legal.
* **Character set / format.** No slug, UUID, DNS-label or ASCII rule.
  ``fabric.propagation`` deliberately round-trips identifiers containing
  spaces, ``=`` and non-ASCII characters; real deployments carry
  identifiers minted by systems the SDK does not control.
* **Case.** Values are never normalized or lower-cased. Matching is
  case-insensitive, but what the caller passed is what gets stored and
  emitted.
* **Environment-ish names.** ``test``, ``dev``, ``local``, ``default``,
  ``demo``, ``sandbox``, ``staging`` and ``example`` are *real* tenant
  and agent names in real deployments and are always accepted.
* **Near-misses of the sentinels.** Bare ``na`` is accepted (it is a
  region code — North America); only ``n/a`` is rejected. Likewise
  ``nullify-corp`` or ``nonesuch`` are accepted: Tier A matches the
  whole stripped value, never a substring.
