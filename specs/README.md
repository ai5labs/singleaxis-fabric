# SingleAxis Fabric — Design of Record

This directory is the **source of truth** for Fabric's product positioning,
architecture, and major design decisions. Every non-trivial change to the
codebase must either implement something here or come with a spec change.

## How specs are numbered

Specs are numbered with a three-digit zero-padded prefix. New specs take
the next unused number. Numbers are never reused; a superseded spec
remains in place with `Status: superseded by NNN`.

Numbers 013-018 and 024 are reserved. They are intentionally absent here; the
next unused public number is 026.

## Status values

Every spec declares a `Status` in its header:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Under discussion; not binding |
| `accepted` | Decided; implementation may begin |
| `implemented` | Behaviour in the code matches the spec |
| `deprecated` | No longer recommended but still supported |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a newer spec (points to successor) |

## How to propose a change

1. Open a pull request that adds a new spec under `specs/` with
   `Status: draft`, or modifies an existing one.
2. Allow 7 calendar days of discussion (lazy consensus; see
   [`../GOVERNANCE.md`](../GOVERNANCE.md)).
3. On acceptance, the PR is merged with `Status: accepted`.
4. When implementation lands, update to `Status: implemented` in a
   follow-up PR.
