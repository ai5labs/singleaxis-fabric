# Fabric Node Collector distribution

This OpenTelemetry Collector Builder distribution is the recorder-v1 runtime:

```text
CAPTURE -> PROTECT -> DELIVER
```

It accepts OTLP, removes unapproved content with an exact metadata allowlist,
buffers protected telemetry, and exports to any customer-selected OTLP/HTTP
destination. SingleAxis Platform is optional.

## Included components

- `fabricguard` — exact metadata allowlisting and native OTLP text scrubbing;
- upstream OTLP receiver, memory limiter and optional development batch
  processor;
- OTLP/HTTP and local debug exporters;
- health, zPages and persistent file-storage extensions.

The recorder binary does not include policy, Presidio, prompt guard, sampling,
judge, red-team, or management components. Their experimental source modules
may remain elsewhere in the repository but are not compiled into this image.

## Build and qualify

```bash
go install go.opentelemetry.io/collector/cmd/builder@v0.150.0
make test
make build
make qualify-config
```

The result is `dist/otelcol-fabric`. `qualify-config` proves that the actual
binary accepts mTLS OTLP ingestion, the protection processor, authenticated
OTLP/HTTP export, and a file-backed persistent sending queue. It does not claim
live destination persistence.

For a CI-built image:

```bash
make qualify-image COLLECTOR_IMAGE=fabric-otelcol:pr
```

## Run

The example uses environment-provided endpoint and authorization values:

```bash
export FABRIC_EXPORT_ENDPOINT=https://otlp.example.com
export FABRIC_EXPORT_AUTH='Bearer <token>'
./dist/otelcol-fabric --config examples/config.yaml
```

Mount the file-storage directory on encrypted persistent storage. Production
deployments should use the Helm `shadow-production` profile, which validates
mTLS, authentication, persistence, retry, overflow, sampling, debug, and
network-policy invariants. That profile disables batching before the persistent
exporter queue so acknowledged telemetry does not wait in volatile memory.

## Reliability boundary

Persistent queues provide bounded at-least-once transport. They may replay a
batch after an ambiguous acknowledgement and cannot survive storage loss,
permanent record rejection, or exhausted capacity. The destination must
deduplicate stable identities and provide authoritative retention evidence.

Queue volumes can contain sensitive telemetry. Protect them with encryption,
least privilege, backup, and lifecycle controls appropriate to the deployment.
